[h1]Is network latency important for this game?[/h1]
This game is client-server and it's less sensitive to network latency (ping) than other RTS. So if you have enough download speed you should be fine. For example US players can play just fine on EU servers and even for players from exotic regions higher latency game still playable.

[b]Current server regions are[/b]: USCentral, EUWest, Australia

Only players from Southern Africa countries reported latency issues.
