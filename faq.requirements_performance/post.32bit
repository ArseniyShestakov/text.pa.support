[h1]Can this game work on a 32bit operating system (OS)?[/h1]
There is 32-bit version, but at moment it's work bad due to 32-bit OS memory limits.
Here is topic which contain  proper explanation of that problem:

If you use proposed workaround game will able to use more memory and it's should work properly, but upgrade to 64-bit OS is recommended.

[b]PS: There is no 32-bit support for Linux and it's not planned.[/b]
